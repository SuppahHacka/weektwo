# Week two reflection
 1. Initial thoughts
 2. Considerations 
 3. Going forward
 
### 1. Initial thoughts
  - Jumping into the 2nd week, I can instantely tell that there was frustrations to be had. 
    - I knew where to start however, thanks to the easy to follow instructions that guide us step by step. 
    - The exercises generally proved to be quite straightforward, with compatibility of software being the biggest headache. 
    
### 2. Considerations 
  - Aside from the technical difficulties faced, I had a moment to reflect on how many tools exist to bring things to the masses. 
    - It's very interesting to see that with the existence of the internet, the access to information is more abundant than ever. 
    - The integration of history's artifacts into online accessible content was something I shrugged off far too easily until this course. 
        - The considerations of this material require human oversight. It is the preservation of information which in turn becomes embedded into the worldwide web. 
        - How does it all end up there? Well, thanks to the tools we have, some of which are taught in this course, digital historians are able to interpret artifacts by sharing them online and having retroactive feedback through another historian's eyes. The speed and efficiency of these tools has greatly contributed to our digital libraries. 
        - To me, the most important too is the **access** and **ease of handling** of this information. The contents being uploaded would be useless if we were not able to find them. This is where institutions like public libraries and universities come into play with the share of materials for scholars all alike to dissect these pieces of information. 
        - However, it isn't so easy. Different governance across the globe mandates the flow of information and our access to it. Copyrighted materials cannot be willfully shared unless permitted by the author. Digital history has surely introduced its share of controversy and inequality as well. 

### 3. Going forward 
Going back to myself and my personal experience in this course 

  - I found it quite challenging to stay on top of my workload. As I also have another course to complete, a fulltime job and a family, it can be hard to find the time to sit down and digest the course's contents. 
  - Going forward, i'd like to keep more tabs into the discord; to avoid running into problems that have already been discussed. That would save me many headaches! 
  - Today, as I sat down and worked my way through the entire week (yes, I had lots of catching up to do) I realized the work is much easier done in one sitting provided no major issues are at hand. The managing of my files, terminals etc.. are easiest when I go from one task to another. 
    - Additionally, jotting down notes is easier as I can go back into my open programs and scroll through the history of what I did (vs having a clean slate the following day). 
    
All in all, my goal moving forward is to dwelve more into the history aspect and be able to have long sessions of productivty (wishful thinking). 

# Cheers!
